*Listing all the Indian hackathons at one place!!*

## **About**

theHackCalendar is a community initiative by theDevArmy aimed at promoting hackathon culture within India. We believe in making it easier for hackathon enthusiasts to find and participate in Indian hackathons. Our goal is to list all the Indian hackathons in one place, providing a convenient way for enthusiasts to stay updated and get involved.

Are you a hackathon enthusiast?

Ofcourse you are! Every engineering student wishes to participate in an hackathon at least once in his/her college life.

### The Problem?

But what's stopping you?

Most probable answers we could expect are as follows:

- “We do not have the required skill set.”
- “We are not aware when and where hackathons are being organized.”

### Solutions.

Well, to solve the first problem we do organize monthly meet-ups in Nagpur, which help enthusiasts to build their skill set. Do checkout our [events](https://thedevarmy.com/events/) page on [theDevArmy's website](https://thedevarmy.com/).

We are going to address the second problem in this particular repository.

For the hackathon enthusiasts in India, we have made it really simple to locate the Indian in-person hackathons. Directly into their own google calendar.

Yes, you heard it right!
